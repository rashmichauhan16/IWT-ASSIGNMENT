        <h2>Status Bar - </h2>The status bar appears at the bottom of your web browser. When you are loading a web  page, this bar usually will show the browserâ€™s progress. Also, when you hover links with your pointer, the 
        address of those links will often appear in this status box. This allows you to see which web page your  browser will load before clicking the link. The status bar can offer more functions when you add 
        extensions or add ons to your browsers.
       <h2> Tabs -</h2> Tabs give your browser the ability to load multiple web pages without opening a new window. To  open a new tab, press Ctrl+T. You then will have a new tab where you can open a new web page and 
        easily switch back and forth between your other tabs. When multitasking, web work without tabs would be nearly impossible.

        <h2>Bookmark</h2> A bookmark is a saved shortcut that directs your browser to a specific webpage. It stores the title, URL, and favicon of the corresponding page. Saving bookmarks allows you to easily access your 
        favorite locations on the Web. All major web browsers allow you to create bookmarks, though each  browser provides a slightly different way of managing them. For example, Chrome and Firefox display 
        your bookmarks in an open window, while Safari displays them in a list in the sidebar of the browser  window. Internet Explorer uses the name "Favorites" to refer to bookmarks, and like Safari, it displays all 
        your favorites in a list within the browser window sidebar.
